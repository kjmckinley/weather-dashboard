# Weather Dashboard
This application is meant to serve as a simple local weather dashboard in which the user can enter their city in a search-field and a 5-day forecast will be displayed for that city. If the user enters another city, then the previous city will be set aside as a clickable button, using local storage, that they can revisit at any time.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```
